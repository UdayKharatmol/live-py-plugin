# Security Policy
This project should be low risk, because it runs locally in your IDE or your browser, and doesn't open any network connections.

## Supported Versions
No vulnerabilities have been reported, so all versions are still supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Report vulnerabilities on GitHub at the project's [security advisories page]. You should expect
to get a response within a month (probably much faster). If the vulnerability is accepted, you should
expect to see a patched release. If not, you should get an explanation of why it was not accepted
or how the vulnerability can be avoided.
